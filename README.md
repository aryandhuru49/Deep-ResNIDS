# Deep ResNIDS

This repository contains the implementation of **Deep ResNIDS**, a Two-Layer Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to detect both **known** and **zero-day attacks**.

The system combines:
1. **Malicious Packet Detector (Supervised Layer)**  
   - Built using **Logistic Regression**  
   - Identifies malicious packets based on known attack patterns.  

2. **Anomaly Detector (Unsupervised Layer)**  
   - Implemented with an **Autoencoder**  
   - Detects **zero-day, adversarial, and automated attacks** by learning the distribution of normal traffic and flagging anomalies through **reconstruction error analysis**.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **100% detection rate** for known attacks.  
- **Robust anomaly detection** to capture novel threats.  
- Built in a **Jupyter Notebook** for clarity, experimentation, and reproducibility.  
- Modular and extendable to other machine learning and deep learning models.
